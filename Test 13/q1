A RESTful API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is an interface that enables the transfer of representations of state on a web-based platform. 
It aims to be simple, flexible, and scalable.

Each request from a client to the server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request.
The server does not store any state about the client session.
